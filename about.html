                    <li id="green-background">The reason why I started the course: "front-end development." For the last couple of years have I been dreaming of living in a van, traveling the world, trying all different sorts of crazy sports, seeing and learning about different new cultures. So I started to think about the best ways to reach my goals. First, did I follow two courses about day trading and how it works, I like it very much, it has great potential like working from your computer and only having to work for three hours a day, but the downside is: it takes a couple (roughly 5 years) to do it well enough to be able to do it fulltime. So I started to think about other options that would give me the same result: "working from my laptop and traveling the world", But faster. When a friend of mine told me about this course and how fast I would be able to get to my goal, did I start watching some videos about this subject. In the end, did I decide to buy this course, which has been a great choice so far.
